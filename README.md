## how to run our app 

### 1) clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/baha-ott/booky.git
```

### 2) navigate to the file then enter the following:
```bash 
cd frontend && npm i

npm run dev
// to run the react server


cd backend && npm i

```
### Tech stack 
* react + typescript
* Tailiwind CSS 
* redux, redux-toolkit
* react-router-dom 
* formik & yup 
* react-icons 


# you may face some problems because of the behavior of typescript ⚠️
## 1. go to the tsconfig.json file
## 2. change "moduleResolution": "bundler" ➡️ "moduleResolution": "node",


# Feel free to open an issue 
# the app still in development so needs to be optimized, you may encounter some issues
